            <h2><strong>The Cycle:</strong></h2>
            <p> It's usually not spotted once it starts to happen. When the pattern starts and one starts to think, "Why is this person acting like this? It nevered happened before?," It can be a confusing situation. The cycle is an order or pattern of different actions, each following the next until the conflict is resolved. The conflict can be resolved if the survivor leaves the relationship or if the abuser recieves some form of intervention.</p>
            <p> Note that the cycle of abuse depends on the relationship. The cycle can last from a few hours to a year or more until it returns to the beginning of the cycle and starts again.The length can change over the course of the relationship.</p>
            <p>Here, the phases list the most common course of actions and examples in each cycle.</p>
                
            <p><strong>Tension Building:</strong> This will build from common stresses such as money, job, independence of another, dependence of the other, miscommunication, or family conflicts. The abuser will feel ignored or wronged in some way, acussing blame to the other. Verbal abuse will start in which the survivor may try to control the situation by being complient or pleasing in order avoid the abuse.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Incident: Abuse takes place</strong><br> As tension increase, physical abuse starts to take place. An abuser in a high emotional state would cause unpredicatable attacks mostly from external situations, <a href="http://www.domesticviolenceroundtable.org/domestic-violence-cycle.html"> not by the victim's behavior.</a> The state of abuse can be unpredictable and spontaneous to the victim's ability to control it. Until the tension is released, the next cycle will come.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Reconciliation: Amends</strong>
            <br>The abuser will ask for forgiveness and feel ashamed or guilty for causing such behavior and acrions for the fear of the victim leaving or calling the police. From this, the victim will be confused, scared, pain, even responsible in thinking the victim caused the action of the abuser to act in such a way. <br> The abuser will be generous and affectionate in order to have the victim forget the incident and move on together, assuring it won't happen again. The abuser may even blame the victim for causing him or her to act in such a way. </p>
              
            
            <p><strong>Calm: The Honeymoon stage</strong> <br>The relationship seems stable and calm. The abuser will act as if the incident never happened and have the victim 'move on,' by giving gifts and kindeness. This will convince the victim that the abuser has change.</p>
